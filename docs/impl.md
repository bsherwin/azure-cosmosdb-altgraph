# AltGraph - Implementation Notes

## Java: JGraphT

The **v2** AltGraph implementation uses an in-memory graph using the **JGraphT library**.
The graph is maintained in the memory of the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), it is
mutable, and offers excellent built-in algorithms (PageRank, DijkstraShortestPath, Centrality, etc.)
so that you don't have to create this logic yourself.

## Java: Guava Graph

I evaluated the Google Guava Graph library as a possible in-memory graph implementation.
I compared it to the above JGraphT library. Though it is more recently maintained,
I chose not to use Google Guava for the graph because its' graph traversal logic
is lacking and the docs were very sparse on this. However, I leave this comment
here for your reference in case you wish to evaluate the Google Guava Graph solution.

## Python, and other Programming Languages

At the current time AltGraph is only implemented in Java & DotNet. Based on customer demand,
it may be implemented in other programming languages in the future.

### DotNet

For DotNet, the QuikGraph software is one possible implementation.

### Python

There is a language binding for Python to JGraphT.
